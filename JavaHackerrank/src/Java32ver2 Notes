Explanation:
Mark as Visited: The current position pos is marked as visited by setting game[pos] = 1
to prevent revisiting the same position.
Boundary Checks: Ensure that the positions are within bounds before moving forward, jumping
forward, or moving backward.
Recursive Approach: The isSolvable method is used to explore all possible moves recursively.
